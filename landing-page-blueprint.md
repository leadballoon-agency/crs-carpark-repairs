## FINAL THOUGHT

This isn't just a landing page. It's a manifesto.

We're saying: "The industry has been overcomplicating this for years. You have a hole. We fill it. Tonight. End of story."

That's Ronseal. That's honest. That's exactly what Paul's customers want.

**And with our photo-to-quote AI, it's exactly what they'll get.**

*Does exactly what it says on the tin. But 500x faster than everyone else.*
