Subject: CRS Digital Platform - Ready for Testing

Hi Paul & Kelsey,

Hope you're both well. The new CRS platform is ready for initial testing at localhost:3002

What's Live:

Main Website & Tools
- Updated landing page with cleaner design
- Interactive damage mapping tool (quite pleased with how this turned out - clients can mark damage on photos)
- Zone-based pricing calculator built in (£2k minimum as discussed)

Client Portal
- Login system for existing clients
- Dashboard showing their sites and service history
- Direct link to damage reporting tool
- Simple onboarding flow for new clients

Admin Dashboard
- Overview of all client activity
- Damage reports management
- Track onboarding leads
- Add existing clients and their sites (yellow "+ Add Client" button)
- Mobile version for checking things on the go

Testing Access:
Portal: http://localhost:3002/portal-api.html
Admin: admin@crs.com / admin123
Test Client: mcdonalds@franchise.com / demo123

The damage mapper is probably worth having a look at - clients can upload a photo, mark problem areas, and WhatsApp it straight through. Keeps everything documented.

Also researched subscription models (Priority Plans) which could be interesting for regular clients. It's built but not prominently featured - just accessible via footer link if you want to explore the concept.

Added a feedback widget (yellow button, bottom right) so you can leave notes as you test. This will help us prioritize what to build next based on your actual needs.

Everything integrates with your existing GHL setup (£95/month location stays as is). Once you're happy with the platform, we can connect the webhooks to trigger your automations.

The whole system runs on a simple Node server - no monthly hosting costs or licenses to worry about.

Let me know when you've had a chance to test. Happy to adjust anything.

Best,
[Your name]
